Assignment 6A - 

In this assignment, a network was given that had to be modified according to the changes specified. 

In the respective jupyter notebook of this assignment, you can find the changes listed and how they have been carried out. 
The network given had a base accuracy. We were to obtain a higher accuracy than that by updating it with the changes and achieve the same with lower number of epochs. 

Functionality of every cell and piece of code that's new has been explained in the notebook.

Assignment 6B - 

We need to rewrite the above network with layers having different types of convolution like seperable convolution (spation and depthwise),convolution with dilation,grouped convolution etc.

Functional API method has been used to build the network in this respective jupyter notebook. 
Space to depth concept has also been introduced here which helps in modifying the dimensions of our output channels which makes it easier to Concatenate. 

Functionality of every cell and piece of code that's new has been explained in the notebook.
